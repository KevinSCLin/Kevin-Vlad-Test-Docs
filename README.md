## Overview of Microsoft Excel Instruction Guide

We have provided you three simple instructions in Microsoft Excel to help you become more productive using this software.
The three instructions will show you how to:

* build a Gantt chart,
* merge data in different tables, and
* create custom headers in Excel VBA.

After going through the instructions we believe that you will have a deeper understanding on how to work with charts,
tabular data, and see the potential in building your own customized programs in Excel VBA.

## How We Constructed the Documentation

We borrowed and forked the [Just the docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/) repository on Github.
This entire documentation format is based on Markdown, a lightweight markup language.
The documentation's theme is based on Jekyll, a blog-aware static site generator.

## How the Team Worked Together

We decided to write something about Microsoft Excel quickly, as we have some experience in using Excel. All of the 
writing and editing were done remotely due to mandatory closure of public schools as a response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The team divided the instruction's sections up and each member worked individually.

The team used Discord and Slack, both messaging applications to communicate and discuss the progress of building this instruction.
Github worked very smoothly and we did not experience any technical issue during the production of this instruction.

## Writing Documents in Markdown

None of us were familiar with Markdown at first, especially with the associated .yaml file that keeps track of
the document's configuration settings. We managed to pick up on the commands for text formatting and links quickly.

### Direct Editing on Github

At the beginning of the production all teammates used Github to edit text directly. Making quick changes was easy 
under Github website. However, the scale of the project quickly made such approach inconvenient for some.

### Using JetBrains Webstorm

Webstorm is a powerful IDE software that integrates version control and webpage preview on the fly, including markdown.
This makes writing and adding elements to a markdown file very straightforward.

## Final Thoughts

Hopefully the instructions we provided can help you become more productive using Microsoft Excel.
