## Overview of instructions

We have provided you three simple instructions in Microsoft Excel to help you become more productive using this software.
The three instructions will show you how to:

* build a Gantt chart,
* merge data in different tables,
* create custom headers in Excel VBA

After going through the instructions we believe that you will have a deeper understanding on how to build charts,
working with tabular data, and see the potential in building your own customized programs in VBA.

## How We Constructed the Documentation

We borrowed and forked the [Just the docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/) repository on Github.
This entire documentation format is based on Markdown, a lightweight markup language.
The documentation's theme is based on Jekyll, a blog-aware static site generator.

### Writing Documents in Markdown

None of us were familiar with Markdown at first, especially with the associated .yaml file that keeps track of
the document's configuration settings. We managed to pick up on the commands for text formatting and links quickly.

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
