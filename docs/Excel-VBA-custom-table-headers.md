##Purpose of this instruction
Sometimes you will need to build a very large table with atypical column and row headers.
Excel's built-in autofill function may not recognize the pattern of column or row labels and does not work.
Instead of manually entering values to thousands of cells, it is easier to use VBA to generate the row and column
labels for us.  

## What is VBA
VBA is an acronym for Visual Basic for Applications, a dialect of Visual Basic embedded in Microsoft Office Suite.
It is widely used in Microsoft Excel as a simple programming language for building macros, forms, and procedures to automate repeating tasks.
