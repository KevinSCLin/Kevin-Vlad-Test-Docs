### Conciseness Helps Web Readers

Many readers of a website expect concise, well formatted and readable text. Otherwise we will leave within 1 second of seeing your website.

For example turn a sentence like this:

>At this point in time we canâ€™t ascertain the reason as to why the screen door was left open.

into this:
```
Now we can't understand why the screen door was left open.
```

And this:

>There is a desire on the part of many of us to maintain a spring break for the purpose of getting away from the demands of our studies.

into this:

```
We desire to use spring break to get away from the demands of our studies. 
```
